CircuitPython RFM69 packet radio module.  This supports basic RadioHead-compatible sending and
receiving of packets with RFM69 series radios (433/915Mhz).

.. note:: This does NOT support advanced RadioHead features like guaranteed delivery--only 'raw' packets are currently supported.

.. warning:: This is NOT for LoRa radios!

.. note:: This is a 'best effort' at receiving data using pure Python code--there is not interrupt
    support so you might lose packets if they're sent too quickly for the board to process them.
    You will have the most luck using this in simple low bandwidth scenarios like sending and
    receiving a 60 byte packet at a time--don't try to receive many kilobytes of data at a time!

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============

See examples/rfm69_simpletest.py for a simple demo of the usage.

Contributing
============

before contributing to help this project stay welcoming.

Building locally
================

To build this library locally you'll need to install the
`circuitpython-build-tools <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-build-tools>`_ package.

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install circuitpython-build-tools

Once installed, make sure you are in the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    source .env/bin/activate

Then run the build:

.. code-block:: shell

    circuitpython-build-bundles --filename_prefix adafruit-circuitpython-rfm69 --library_location .

Sphinx documentation
-----------------------

Sphinx is used to build the documentation based on rST files and comments in the code. First,
install dependencies (feel free to reuse the virtual environment from above):

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install Sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme

Now, once you have the virtual environment activated:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd docs
    sphinx-build -E -W -b html . _build/html

This will output the documentation to ``docs/_build/html``. Open the index.html in your browser to
view them. It will also (due to -W) error out on any warning like Travis will. This is a good way to
locally verify it will pass.
