# should_I_water
Hello, for several years I posted the details of projects I have worked on at my [bitknitting blog](https://bitknitting.wordpress.com/),  But - hey, looky here!  GitHub has a wiki for each project.  So I switched to this method for documentation.  
  
The challenge is along the way I have bumbled through different accounts and such.

I contribute as both bitknitting@github.com and farmerrobbie@github.com ...Why farmer Robbie?  Long (boring?) story...  

Anywho....in reality I am Margaret Johnson.   My email is something line happy+++++++@gmail.com.  

I hope some of the stuff I've worked on can help jump start what you are doing.  Worst case, I have notes for what I did that will help jump start future projects (as it seems I slowly lose my mind...).
